# Native Memory Scripter

Native Memory Scripter is a plugin which allows you to create a native plugin by writing Python scripts. This saves a lot of time and makes the process of native plugin dev a lot easier.

# Modders
If you'd like to write a native mod script, see the documentation [here](https://molotovcherry.github.io/Native-Memory-Scripter/)

# Features
- Use Python to manipulate memory
- Assembly of plaintext asm / disassembly of bytes
- Virtual method table hooking
- Module search, loading, and unloading
- Segment search (pages)
- External symbol search in modules with name demangling support
- Import address table search and hooking
- Pattern scanning for bytes in memory (supports AVX2, SSE4.2, and regular scalar scanning)
- Memory manipulation (read, write, set, and allocate memory)
- Call native functions from python, and hook (vmt, iat, and jmp) native functions with a python callback, along with trampoline to call the original
  - Powered by a JIT compiler
- Written in Rust ðŸ¦€
