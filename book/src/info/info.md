# info

This module contains useful native memory scripter plugin information to scripts. This can also give you context in your scripts.

```admonish warning title="API compatibility"
One such useful property is [version](./version.md), which gives you native memory scripter's current version. This lets you handle api changes gracefully even when there are different native memory scripter versions installed on users computers.
